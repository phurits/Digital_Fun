  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 50 IOs, 49 are locked
   and 1 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   7 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   5 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_71" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_6/XLXN_233" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_138/Q" (FF) removed.
   The signal "N1" is loadless and has been removed.
   The signal "XLXI_6/XLXI_138/Q_Q_MUX_3_o" is loadless and has been removed.
    Loadless block "XLXI_6/XLXI_138/Mmux_Q_Q_MUX_3_o11_INV_0" (BUF) removed.
Loadless block "XLXI_91/XLXI_7" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_91/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "XLXI_91/XLXI_6" (AND) removed.
Loadless block "XLXI_98/XLXI_7" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_98/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "XLXI_98/XLXI_6" (AND) removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
